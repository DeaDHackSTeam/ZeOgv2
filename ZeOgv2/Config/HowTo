Tuto files: Its simple
1. The script is gonna to ask you what type of backdoor you need it depends on you, https & http will use a http port default is 80 but TCP is more used so
i recommend you using TCP for the first time.
2. Simply put your IP know that a local IP wont allow you to hack SOMEONE OUT OF YOUR NETWORK/WIFI. If you want to hack someone outside of your WiFi use your private
IP.
3. Really simple just put the port you want the listener to be listening on by default http & https uses 80 and for TCP is 4444/443/80, you can make a custom one
simply with your router admin page.
4. The script is gonna to ask you for an encoder if you don't know what is a encoder its a encryption like AES-128 that will allow you to encrypt the virus
wich will make it harder to detect the best one if the first one. :)
5. It will ask you for a name well put whatever you want the virus to be called.

Don't worry about the path its gonna to create it on your desktop!
It was simple right!!! xD
I make simple scripts for everyone.
I hope you guys like it!
